# Project Intro

This is my first-ever Github repository. So glad to be here and start doing some fun data projects out of my own interest. :)

In this repository, I would like to utilize the data from [Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) to discover the Covid trends in China from different standpoints. The initial purpose is for me to get familiar with basic usages of [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) for interactive data visualization but I would also like to explore some functionalities from [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) if necessary.

# Thoughts on the Topic
From my point of view, China responded rapidly when the Covid massive spread arises at Wuhan City in Hubei Province at January 2020. The authority took effective though controversial efforts to control the spread and tried to recover the economy as much as possible. After almost a half year's peaceful time, the pandemic came back to the country with outbreak started at suburb Shijiazhuang City which is the capital city of Hebei Province and is only 180 miles away from Beijing. I think it would be worthwhile to investigate the data trends to see how well was the pandemic controlled in 2020 and how does this wave of outbreak look like. It would be interesting to see after a whole year, with winter time happening again, if the outbreak can be contained with a better practice and efficiency.
